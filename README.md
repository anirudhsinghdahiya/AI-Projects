## Probabilistic Language Identification

### Description
This project involves developing a probabilistic model to identify the language of a given text. The model utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset comprising text samples from various languages. The process includes data preprocessing, training the classifier, and evaluating its performance on language detection tasks.

### Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization: Splitting the text into tokens (words or characters).
  - Normalization: Converting text to a consistent format (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**:
  - Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm to calculate the probability of each language given the input text.
  - Training the classifier using a multilingual dataset.

- **Language Detection**:
